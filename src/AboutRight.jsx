                I sparked my passion for web development through self-learning <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>  after graduating from high school. <strong>W3School</strong>  provided a fantastic platform to build my foundation. <br /> To further my skills, I enrolled at WEPRO learning center, where I delved into both front-end and back-end development, gaining proficiency in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. My knowledge extends to creating interactive web applications using the popular <strong>React</strong> framework..

                In addition to my technical skills, I'm multilingual, speaking <strong>Uzbek</strong>, <strong>English</strong> (IELTS 6.5), <strong>Russian</strong> and <strong>Tadjik</strong>. My strong math background from high school further complements my <strong>problem-solving</strong> abilities.

           <p className="about_minor">This dedication to growth has led to my acceptance into <strong>Temple University</strong>'s <strong>Computer Science</strong> program.  I'm excited to continue honing my skills and delve deeper into the fascinating world of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI), particularly the field of <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong> (HCI).</p>
